# Spots

An image sharing site/application.

## Description

The aim of this webpage/application, was to create an image sharing interface that can be properly viewed in 3 different resolutions for different devices. The resolutions include the desktop format, tablet format, and mobile format. The specific numbers are 1440p, 720p and 360p respectively.The use of media querries was nescessary to ensure that all text, icons, and images could fit the designated resolutions listed above. Both flexbox and grid were required to ensure that all assets were aligned correctly on the page in general. The project will be further developed in upcoming Trippleten sprints.

-VS Code - Our trusted IED for for web development.
-git/gitbash - Was used to save and document changes to the web application during development.
-Github - Was used to store the saved changes that were pushed from git. It is also a great platform for web deployment.
